# NY-Times
This project consists of making a clone of a New York Times article page. By this point, we should be familiar with the concepts of:

   Embedding images
   Working with forms (buttons in this case)
   Floats and positioning
   The box model

How to setup a repo of this page on your local machine:

Open your git bash and cd to the location you'd like to put your files the run the command below.

    git clone https://github.com/samir011235/NY-Times.git
